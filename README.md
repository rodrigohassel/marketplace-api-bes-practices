# Marketplace API project with Ruby

A learning API project with the best practices on ruby language and rails framework.

## Versions
* Ruby 3.3.3
* Rails 7.2.1

## Challenges

I have a feeling that you guys might have to know about professional experience:
- 10+ years experienced developer
- 10+ years Delphi developer (object pascal)
- 10+ years database developer/architect/designer whatever you want to call
- 10+ years PostgreSQL

So the challenges are:
- Learning a new language with a new architecture model
- Covered with tests
- Deployable application

## Achievements skills

[x] - Initialize rails api application
[x] - Configuring PostgreSQL database enviroment
[] - Learn about puma web server gem configuration
[x] - Learn about database.yml configuration
[] - Learn about rswag gem 
[] - Learn about rspec gem
[] - Learn about ffaker gem (refactor of gem faker)
[] - Learn about simplecov gem 



 
Copy the `README-default.md` file for yourself and start editing! At the root of
your project, run:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jehna/readme-best-practices/master/README-default.md > README.md
```

The code above fetches the `README-default.md` file from this repository and
renames it to `README.md`.

## Fill with your own text

The default template has some guiding text to get you started. However, you'll
need to edit the file with your own text to use it with your project.

```shell
code README.md
```

If you're using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) code editor, the code above opens the
file for editing. If necessary, substitute with your preferred markdown editor.

### Add to git and push

After you've filled your `README.md` file with your own project's text, you
should push it to your GitHub project:

```shell
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added: README"
```

This adds the `README.md` file to your git repository, creates a commit for it
and pushes it to GitHub (or your preferred remote repository).

## Features

This project makes it easy to:
* Bootstrap your open-source project properly
* Make sure everyone gets what you're trying to achieve with your project
* Follow simple instructions for a perfect `README.md`

## Contributing

As I use this for my own projects, I know this might not be the perfect approach
for all the projects out there. If you have any ideas, just
[open an issue][issues] and tell me what you think.

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make changes as
you'd like. Pull requests are warmly welcome.

If your vision of a perfect `README.md` differs greatly from mine, it might be
because your projects are vastly different. In this case, you can create a
new file `README-yourplatform.md` and create the perfect boilerplate for that.

E.g. if you have a perfect `README.md` for a Grunt project, just name it as
`README-grunt.md`.
